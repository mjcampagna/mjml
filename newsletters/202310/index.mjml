        <mj-text css-class="article">
          <h2>Have you tried Kookaburra?</h2>

          <p>Backlight is still at version 5.3.2, but there are new articles on the blog. We take a look at all the reasons you should be using, or at least trying, Kookaburra ...</p>


          <p>Backlight 5 and Kookaburra had their one-year anniversary in August. Time does fly! Like a bird! You might say, like a kookaburra.</p>
          <p>The Kookaburra series design modules launched as -- and remain, and will remain for some time to come -- works in progress. That said, I've spent more than a year chipping away at <a href="https://discourse.theturninggate.net/t/kookaburra-roadmap/2313/3">the roadmap</a>, so I think it's high time to check in on, and to drum up some hype for Kookaburra!</p>

          <p>Kookaburra was usable, with distinct advantages from the very beginning. A year later, the number of advantages has increased, and the new essay features are probably my favorite thing.</p>

          <h3>Essay Anywhere!</h3>
          <p>...</p>

          <h3>High-definition Image Renditions</h3>
          <p>Your images look better, clearer, sharper in Kookaburra. Period. That's what photo websites are all about, right?</p>
          <p>To wit, Kookaburra utilizes multiple image renditions and `srcset` definitions to ensure your images look their best in albums and essays.</p>
          <p>Migrating collections from Okapi or Pangolin, you will need to republish your images to see benefit; new renditions need to be generated by Kookaburra templates. That done, images in Kookaburra look better than in any prior version of Backlight.</p>

          <h3>Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO</h3>
          <p>Over the past year, we have not only maintained Kookaburra's high performance scores, but have honed them to perfection!</p>
          <p>A Google <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a> score is the rating Google gives your site based on a combination of performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practice criteria in artificial conditions that mimic real ones. Site's are "graded" based on four buckets of criteria and rated 0 - 100. The higher the score out of 100, the better.</p>
          <p>In Backlight 5.3.2, Kookaburra aces the test.</p>
        </mj-text>  
        <mj-image alt="Backlight 5.3.2 Lighthouse Scores" src="https://github.com/mjcampagna/mjml/blob/main/newsletters/202310/Backlight-5-Album-Lighthouse-Audit-20230930.png?raw=true" />
        <mj-text css-class="article">
          <p>These results are from an audit performed on September 30, 2023, with Backlight 5.3.2. The album under audit here is using Kookaburra Album, and contains 200+ images. The colorful dots on the left? That's the browser celebrating our perfect scores by animating confetti explosions, because Kookaburra is worthy of celebration.</p>

          <h3>Keyboard Accessibility</h3>
          <p>Kookaburra has been built from the ground up with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#keyboard-accessible" target="_blank">keyboard accessibility</a> as a priority, and Kookaburra-based websites are 100% navigable using only the keyboard.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) international standard</a>, or a closely related derivative thereof, is specifically codified into law 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines#WCAG_referenced_by_law" target="_blank">in numerous countries</a>, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Israel, and countries within the European Union.</p>
          <p>Keyboard accessibility is covered under operability <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#keyboard-accessible" target="_blank">Guideline 2.1</a> in the WCAG specification. In short, Kookaburra puts you on good footing for accessibility, and helps to ensure the compliance and longevity of your website.</p>

          <h3>Selectively Modern</h3>
          <p>Times, they are a'changin'. Since launching Backlight 5 in 2022, crypto-currencies, non-fungible tokens, and artificial intelligence have taken their turns in the cultural spotlight. Here at The Turning Gate, we want none of them.</p>
          <p>Backlight is stubbornly Web 1.0 in a Web 3.0 world. But that's a good thing, because while social media platforms and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" target="_blank">SaaS</a> giants are vying for all of your attention and creative output to benefit only themselves, <strong>Backlight empowers you to own your content</strong>.</p>
          <p>For example, Kookaburra Essay encourages human authorship over ChatGPT regurgitation of siphoned works. Tell your stories, using your photos.</p>
          <p>Forgoing buzzworthy tech, Kookaburra leans into modern best practices; see the perfect 100 for "Best Practices" in our Lighthouse score!</p>
          <p>In one manifestation of modern best practices, Kookaburra jetisons jQuery in favor of lighter, tighter, purpose-driven JavaScript. We've had to make sacrifices in cutting jQuery (see below) but our street cred has never been greater. Just look at our Lighthouse scores!</p>

          <hr />

          <h2>To Kookaburra, or not to Kookaburra ... ?</h2>
          <p>Kookaburra is great, but it's not yet a one-to-one replacement for Pangolin. Let's talk about it.</p>

          <h3>Cart &amp; Client Response Albums</h3>
          <p>I would like for Kookaburra to eventually support the Cart and Client Response add-ons, but that's still pretty far out on the roadmap. If you need these features, you will need to use Pangolin to create those album templates.</p>
          <p>You might consider a hybrid approach, however. If your site is structured in such a way that you can separate your cart or response albums from your porfolio albums, then you might use Kookaburra for your pages and portfolio albums, and Pangolin only where you need it.</p>

          <h3>Galleria &amp; Theater Albums</h3>
          <p>Kookaburra does not, and will not support these add-ons, as they do require the jQuery library as a dependency. The jQuery library is now antiquated, and not a part of Kookaburra.</p>
          <p>However, I am working to expand presentation options within Kookaburra. A Galleria/Vegas-like presentation is on the roadmap for Kookaburra, with high priority.</p>

          <h3>A Kookaburra Wordpress Theme</h3>
          <p>It will be the last thing I do, if I do it at all. Very low priority. If you really need Backlight to create a Wordpress theme, then Pangolin.</p>

          <h3>Masonry &amp; Justified Grids</h3>
          <p>Sacrificed on the altar of jQuery. If I can find or figure out how to write suitable alternatives, they may return, but that research is far out on the roadmap.</p>

          <h2>The new "Bricolage Grotesque" typeface</h2>
          <p><a href="https://ateliertriay.github.io/bricolage/">Bricolage Grotesque</a> is a new open source typeface from the creators of Marvin Visions, the typeface that I use for Backlight's logo.</p>
          <p>Its webpage describes Bricolage Grotesque as "a free and open source variable font with French attitude and British mannerisms across 3 axis: weight, width &amp; optical size."</p>

            <dd>The field of A.I. is moving so quickly, it's difficult to keep up with. I find it difficult to be optimistic about the way things are going, though glimmers of hope do sometimes emerge from the morass of despondence.
